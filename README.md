# Introduction

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh///master?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains the material for the course Training in ade4 in
R - Module I: Basic methods.

## Contents

The directory contains the material for the first four sessions (course
and practical). The last session is designed for open discussion and
personal work. The structure of this compendium is as follows:

  - [:file\_folder: course](/course): Source (R Markdown) to reproduce
    the slides of the course. It contains also rendered versions (html
    and pdf documents) suitable for reading (the code is replaced by
    figures and tables in these files)
  - [:file\_folder: practical](/practical): Source and rendered versions
    of the slides. Corrections of practical are provided as R codes to
    reproduce the different analyses

## Program

  - **Session 1**: Welcome, presentation of participants. Introduction,
    packages installation. Theory and 3D explanation of multivariate
    methods.

    ade4 in R. Group work and discussions on data sets presented by
    participants.

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This course has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need installed on your
computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and
optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping: - open the `.Rproj`
file in RStudio - run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). - finally, source `make.R` to compile
the different documents of the course.
